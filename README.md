# OutfitMaker (Digital Personalized Closet)

This is a only made for fun.

This web application lets you create a digital outfit based from the (uploaded) clothes you have.
Simply take a photo of your clothes, then labeled it based from its type/category.

Features:
[1] Lets you customize your own digital closet.
[2] Can save outfit that is on "Outfit Preview".


To-add:
[1] Automatically make the bg of the uploaded images to white for uniformity.
[2] Add features like: Can add clothes to favourites, Smarter Outfiti Randomizer, etc.

I'm open for suggestions.
